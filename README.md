# IRGAN-PyTorch
This project contains a pytorch implementation about the item recommendation part of [IRGAN: A Minimax Game for Unifying Generative and Discriminative Information Retrieval Models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3077136.3080786). The official implementation (TensorFlow version) can be found [here](https://github.com/geek-ai/irgan).
